        Every image is elaborated locally, and nothing is shared to an external
        server. Connections are made to Google Fonts to fetch the 'Work Sans'
        font and to GitHub for downloading the necessary scripts to make
        image-converter work. After these contents have been downloaded, you're
        able to use image-convert completely offline. image-converter does not
        share any data with them.
